(Computer-Assisted Instruction) Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) refers to the
use of computers in education. Write a script to help an elementary school student learn
multiplication. Create a function that randomly generates and returns a tuple of two pos
itive one-digit integers. Use that functionâ€™s result in your script to prompt the user with a
question, such as
How much is 6 times 7?
For a correct answer, display the message "Very good!" and ask another multiplication
question. For an incorrect answer, display the message "No. Please try again." and let
the student try the same question repeatedly until the student finally gets it right.
